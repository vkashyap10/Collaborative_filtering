# Music Recommendation System

## Introduction

## Dataset

MFCC Features for each track downloaded from http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/mir/msd/

We originally wanted to extract timbres and use GMM on the individual timbres, and use their cluster weights to weight song cluster assignments. However we could not obtain the MSD dataset, and had to work with aggregated MFCC features on individual tracks.
